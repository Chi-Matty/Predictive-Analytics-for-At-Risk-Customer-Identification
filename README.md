# Predictive Analytics for At-Risk Customer Identification

## Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn by selecting an appropriate algorithm, training and validating the model, and defining evaluation metrics to assess its performance. The goal is to generate actionable insights that help the business identify at-risk customers and inform strategies for customer retention.

## Project Summary:
This project involved end-to-end predictive analytics for customer churn at Lloyds. 

#### Tasks included:
Data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, integration, and exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior. Random Forest classifier was used to predict churn risk based on demographic and behavioral features, with model performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and precision-recall curves. Threshold calibration was also applied to accurately identify churners while minimizing misclassification of loyal customers, providing insights to support informed business decisions on customer retention strategies.
